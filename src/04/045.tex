\section{Primal Reachability}
\label{sect:045}

\paragraph{}Recall that one of the question we posted in \Cref{sect:042} asks whether $Q^\ast,F^\ast$ are nonempty. The case of $Q^\ast$ (dual reachability) can be obtained in some cases via the Slater's conditions or complementary slackness. The case of $F^\ast$ as mentioned before is more intricate. In the case of linear programs, we have given one such result in \Cref{prop:043-linear-reachability}: when $f^\ast\in \mathbb{R}$, $F^\ast\neq\emptyset$.

\paragraph{}In this section, we will extend both the proof and the result of \Cref{prop:043-linear-reachability}, to derive the fundamental theorem of linear programming, as well as giving a condition where primal optimal set is nonempty (or compact) via recession cones.

\begin{prop}[Primal Optimal Set - Linear Case]\label{prop:045-linear-primal-optimality}
	Suppose $f$ is affine in \Cref{defn:040-opt-prob} and $f^\ast\in \mathbb{R}$.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item If $F^\ast \cap \operatorname{ri}(F)\neq\emptyset$, then $f$ is constant on $F$.
		\item (Fundamenal Theorem of Linear Programming) If $F$ is polyhedral, $\operatorname{ext}(F)\neq\emptyset$, then $F^\ast\cap\operatorname{ext}(F)\neq\emptyset$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	For both items, by replacing the basic feasibility region, we may assume that there are no constraints and that the basic feasibility region is $F$. For (a), take $x_0\in F^\ast \cap \operatorname{ri}(F)$, and take $x\in F$. By (b) of \Cref{prop:012-basic-ri}, may express $x_0=I(x,x'; \alpha )$ for some $x\in F$, $\alpha \in (0,1)$, giving:
	\[
		f^\ast \leq I(f(x),f(x');\alpha )=f(I(x,x';\alpha ))=f(x_0)=f^\ast
	\]
	giving $x\in F^\ast$. For (b), note that $F^\ast\neq\emptyset$ by \Cref{prop:043-linear-reachability}; take a point $x_0\in F^\ast$. If $x_0\in \operatorname{ri}(F)$, then we are done by (a); otherwise, by (e) of \Cref{prop:015-hyperplane-sep} and the remarks following it, we have for some $(a,b)\in \mathbb{S}^{m-1}\times \mathbb{R}$, that $F\subset E_{a,b,+},x_0\in H_{a,b,-}$. Now we use \Cref{lemm:016-extreme-and-hyperlane}, and replace $F$ by $F\cap H_{a,b}$; this process cannot continue indefinitely (consider $\dim(F)$), giving the assertion.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Primal Optimal set via Recession Cones]
	Suppose in \Cref{defn:040-opt-prob}, $X,f$ are closed convex, $g$ has closed convex components, and that $F\neq\emptyset$.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item If $R_X\cap R_f=L_X\cap L_f$, then $F^\ast\neq\emptyset$, and $F^\ast=L_X\cap L_f+X'$ with $X'$ compact.
		\item If $R_X\cap R_f\subset L_f$ with $X$ polyhedral, then $F^\ast\neq\emptyset$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Notable cases that will imply (a): when $f$ has a nonempty compact level set or when $\operatorname{dom}(f)$ is bounded.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	These follows from applying \Cref{coro:014-decomp-compact} (for (a)) or \Cref{prop:014-non-empt-II} (for (b)), with the nested sequence of closed convex sets $\{C_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ given by $C_i=F\cap V_{f,\gamma_i}$ where $\{\gamma_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}\to f^{\ast,+}$.
\end{proof}
